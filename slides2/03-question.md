#### Step 3 - Ask Questions!?
Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/summer-symfony

A) Use the "Question" helper to ask the user the
following question:

    How many times should we greet you?

Then, if the user enters "10", print
the greeting 10 times.

B) If the user doesn't enter a number,
default it to 10.

**GOAL**

You should now see the question asked. When
you enter a number, you see the greeting that
many times.

**EXTRA CREDIT**

Add validation so that if the user does not
enter a number, it will ask the user again.
