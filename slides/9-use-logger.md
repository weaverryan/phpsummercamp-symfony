Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/summer-symfony

A) In `indexAction`, get the `logger` service and use it
to log a message like "Random string is 5".

**GOAL**

When you refresh, you can click anywhere on the "web debug toolbar"
and then click the "LOGS" panel on the left to see your message!

**EXTRA CREDIT**

* Play with the other methods of the logger object, like
`error`, `warning` or `alert`.
