#### Step 6: Override the Twig title block

A) Override the `title` block in the `index.html.twig` template.

**GOAL**

When you refresh, the title of the page should be different.

**EXTRA CREDIT**

* Add a new `sidebar` block to `base.html.twig` and give it
some default content.

* Override `sidebar` in `index.html.twig`, but use the
`parent()` Twig function to *add* to the default content,
instead of overriding it

* Download and bring in the Twitter Bootstrap CSS file.
Put it in the `stylesheets` block of `base.html.twig`
