#### Welcome to Symfony Basics!

To get started, make sure everything is loading ok! If you're having
any problems at all, just ask!

A) Start up the virtual machine!

B) You should be able to go to
`http://sfbasics.ezsc/app_dev.php` and see a pretty
Symfony error page saying "no route found".

C) Make sure you have a nice editor on your system and you're
able to see and edit the files on the virtual machine.

D) Say "Hi" to your neighbor :)
